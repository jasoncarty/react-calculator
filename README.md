## React calculator
A simple calulator application. Shows 3 fields in which values can be added. As values are added to the fields, the answer is shown in the pink block.
There are 2 different types of calculations to choose from: SUM and MULTIPLICATION.

For this project I chose to use React. I chose this because it is something that I am familiar with and I feel that it offers a great component based design. This type of design has many benifits, including re-usablity and maintabilty.

Another technology used in this project is redux. I chose to use this so that I could have a global state in the application, which simplifies the sharing of state between components.

The project can be seen live at [react calculator](https://jasoncarty.github.io/react-calculator/)
